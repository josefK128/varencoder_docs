 'The main contributions of this paper are as follows. White and black pixels in the image indicate edge and non-edge regions, respectively. In the following, we approach this generic idea under a specific interactive framework. We combine a modern denoising Neural Network with Radiance Caching to offer high performance CPU GI rendering while supporting a wide range of material types, without the requirement of offline pre-computation or training for each scene.
