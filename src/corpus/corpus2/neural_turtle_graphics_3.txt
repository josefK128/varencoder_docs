We propose Neural Turtle Graphics, a novel generative model for spatial graphs, and demonstrate its applications in modeling city road layouts. Specifically, we
represent the road layout using a graph where nodes in the
graph represent control points and edges in the graph represents road segments. Neural Turtle graphics is a sequential generative model
parameterized by a neural network. It iteratively generates
a new node and an edge connecting to an existing node conditioned on the current graph.

City road layout modeling is an important problem with
applications in various fields. In urban planning, extensive
simulation of city layouts are required for ensuring that the
final construction leads to effective traffic flow and connectivity.

Graph generation with
neural networks has only recently gained attention uses an Recursive Neural network to generate a graph as a sequence
of nodes sorted by breadth-first order. It also predicts edges to
previous nodes as the new node is added. Producing valid geometry and topology makes our problem particularly challenging.
