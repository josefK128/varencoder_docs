$$$Visual Indeterminacy

GAN art often exhibits
visual indeterminacy. GANs cause visual indeterminacy by creating
plausible compositions and textures that nonetheless defy coherent explanation, and these are the
GAN images often used in recent artworks. Because visual indeterminacy can be understood as a
perceptual process, GANs provide a potential tool for both art and for neuroscience experiments
based on perceptual uncertainty modeling.

Often, the initial appearance of an image invites the viewer to investigate further, but the image
confounds explanation. For some images, this investigation leads to an “Aha!” moment, where the
viewer understands the structure of an image. They see a vivid 3D object where there had
been abstract 2D shapes. This moment is pleasurable because the posterior distribution collapses.
Some understanding has been gained. But the image may also become less interesting as result.

Natural image models, vision neuroscience, and image synthesis have long been tightly-coupled
fields. Discoveries about the visual cortex led to natural image statistics analysis, which
led to texture synthesis algorithms which led to style transfer algorithms. At the same
time, cortical modeling also led to deep convolution networks, which led to GANs and trained
discriminative networks, which, in turn, have led to improved neuroscience models. Can aspects
of aesthetic experience be understood with the same models?

Ideally, a generator would accurately represent a distribution over natural images; a recognition
model would be the inverse, providing a posterior distribution over interpretations that would
approximate human perceptual uncertainty. Optimization against this model would give artists more
precise control over the type of perceptual uncertainty present in images, for example, to produce
images with specific types of visual indeterminacy.

This would provide artists with higher-level controls to explore artistic creation. It could also provide
a richer testbed to develop perceptual theories of aesthetic experience, rather than using hand-crafted
artwork.

A more fine-grained neural model of indeterminacy is needed, to account for the temporal evolution
from first impressions [14], to the movement of attention, to the possibility of the “Aha!” moment.
Moreover, the categorization of perceptual ambiguity in art is very preliminary and much work
remains to be done to expand upon and refine it.
