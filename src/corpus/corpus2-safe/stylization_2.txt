$$$Cubic Stylization
$$$https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02926.pdf

We present a 3D stylization algorithm that can turn an input shape into
the style of a cube while maintaining the content of the original shape. 
The key insight is that cubic style sculptures can be captured by the as rigid as possible energy with a regularization on rotated surface normals.
Minimizing this energy naturally leads to a detail preserving cubic geometry.
Our optimization can be solved efficiently without any mesh surgery. Our
method serves as a non-realistic modeling tool where one can incorporate
many artistic controls to create stylized geometries.

The availability of image stylization filters and non-photorealistic
rendering techniques has dramatically lowered the barrier of creating artistic imagery to the point that even a non-professional user
can easily create stylized images. In stark contrast, direct stylization of 3D shapes or non-realistic modeling has received far less
attention. In professional industries such as visual effects and video
games, trained modelers are still required to meticulously create
non-realistic geometric assets. This is because investigating geometric styles is more challenging due to arbitrary topologies, curved
metrics, and non-uniform discretization. The scarcity of tools to
generate artistic geometry remains a major roadblock to the development of geometric stylization.
