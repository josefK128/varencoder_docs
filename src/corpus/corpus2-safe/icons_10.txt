$$$Adversarial Colorization

We present a system to help designers create icons that are widely
used in banners, signboards, billboards, homepages, and mobile
apps. Designers are tasked with drawing contours, whereas our system colorizes contours in different styles. This goal is achieved by
training a dual conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)
on our collected icon dataset.

***

One condition requires the generated
image and the drawn contour to possess a similar contour, while
the other anticipates the image and the referenced icon to be similar
in color style. Accordingly, the generator takes a contour image
and a man-made icon image to colorize the contour, and then the
discriminators determine whether the result fulfills the two conditions.

. The trained network is able to colorize icons demanded by
designers and greatly reduces their workload. For the evaluation,
we compared our dual conditional GAN to several state-of-the-art
techniques. Experiment results demonstrate that our network is
over the previous networks.

Nowadays, icons are widely utilized in banners, signboards, billboards, homepages, and mobile apps. Effective icons are usually
simple but distinguishable, so that users can quickly receive the
intended information when seeing them at a small size or a long
distance.

Considering aesthetics and practical issues, designing an
eye-catching icon is challenging. Designers have to carefully consider not only shapes and structures, but also colors, when they
create icons for their customers. 

***

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proven
to be able to generate realistic images in many applications and could constitute a solution to help designers
colorize icons. Specifically, a network takes a contour image drawn
by the designers as input and then outputs the colorized icon image.

***

To control the colorization process, additional inputs, such as stroke colors
and style images, are fed into the network as well. The features
extracted from both contour and style images will be fused and
used for the colorization. 

***

Observing that an icon can be well defined by color and structure conditions, we present a dual conditional GAN to
colorize icons. Rather than training a discriminator to recognize
whether an icon is man-made or machine-generated, we train two
discriminators to determine whether paired images are similar in
structure and color

***

We represent the structure condition by a binary contour image.
White and black pixels in the image indicate edge and non-edge
regions, respectively. To obtain this contour image, the Canny edge
detection algorithm is adopted. Intuitively, each icon and its corresponding contour can match, and otherwise cannot.

***

Since applying a referenced icon to specify the color condition is not
intuitive, we let users simply select a style label when using our system to create icons. Specifically, we consider the color psychology
theory and define the style of a man-made icon according to its
color combination.
