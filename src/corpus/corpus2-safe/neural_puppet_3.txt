We propose a learning based method for generating new
animations of a cartoon character given a few example images. Our method is designed to learn from a traditionally
animated sequence, where each frame is drawn by an artist,
and thus the input images lack any common structure, correspondences, or labels. We express pose changes as a deformation of a layered 2.5D template mesh, and devise a
novel architecture that learns to predict mesh deformations
matching the template to a target image. This enables us
to extract a common low-dimensional structure from a diverse set of character poses. 

***

we propose a method that learns
to generate novel character appearances from a small number of examples by relying on additional user input: a deformable puppet template. We assume that all character
poses can be generated by warping the deformable template, and thus develop a deformation network that encodes
an image and decodes deformation parameters of the template. These parameters are further used in a differentiable
rendering layer that is expected to render an image that
matches the input frame.

Some recent work suggests that neural networks can
jointly learn the template parameterization and optimize for
the alignment between the template and a 3D shape or
2D images. While these models can make inferences over unlabeled data, they are trained on a large number of examples with rich labels, such as dense or sparse
correspondences defined for all pairs of training examples.
