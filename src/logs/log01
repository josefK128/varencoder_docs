original docs:
docs[0] = We present a 3D stylization algorithm that can turn an input shape into the style of a cube while maintaining the content of the original shape. The key insight is that cubic style sculptures can be captured by the as rigid as possible energy with a regularization on rotated surface normals. 

docs[1] = The availability of image stylization filters and non-photorealistic rendering techniques has dramatically lowered the barrier of creating artistic  imagery to the point that even a non-professional user can easily create stylized images. In stark contrast, direct stylization of  3D shapes or non-realistic modeling has received far less attention.
