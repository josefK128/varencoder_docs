docs_[0] = based on position and normal guidance Given a point cloud our algorithm is able to recognize multiscale ridge-valley features by judging the distance from the current point to the curvature extreme point. 
In addition, subsequent processing, such as resampling and smooth filtering, may further damage these features. 
A simple and effective ridge-valley point. 
It is a pictorial game consisting of interactive rounds of creation between artists and a machine. 
Recently, GANs put a spotlight on the creative power of neural networks. 

docs_[1] = Hence art creation could benefit of new tools while simultaneously supporting thoughts of how these interactions are affecting humans. 
In addition, subsequent processing, such as resampling and smooth filtering, may further damage these features. 
During this process, factors such as object surface reflection and sensor quantization error will affect the accuracy of the data acquisition and weaken the sharpness of the original features. 
Our installation where the machine projects completions without painting, combined with generative network capability, allows to explore that in a principled way. 
Actually, some painters have expressed how evocative unintended strokes could be.

Recently, GANs put a spotlight on the creative power of neural networks. 
Our optimization can be solved efficiently without any mesh surgery. 

docs_[3] = In addition, subsequent processing, such as resampling and smooth filtering, may further damage these features. 
Yet in these, humans are either engineers or curators.

docs_[6] = They repetitively paint one after the other. 
As such, the interaction is not innocuous, even though, contrarily to our daily experience, we have made the machine impact as explicit as possible with its recognizable blue contributions.

docs_[7] = In addition, subsequent processing, such as resampling and smooth filtering, may further damage these features. They repetitively paint one after the other. From an outside perspective, the machine distorts their original painting style, both on the short term artworks resulting from their interaction (see Figure 2), and on their long term body of work as it inspired them on their machine-free paintings. It is a pictorial game consisting of interactive rounds of creation between artists and a machine.

During this process, factors such as object surface reflection and sensor quantization error will affect the accuracy of the data acquisition and weaken the sharpness of the original features. The key insight is that cubic style sculptures can be captured by the as rigid as possible energy with a regularization on rotated surface normals. It is a pictorial game consisting of interactive rounds of creation between artists and a machine. We present a 3D stylization algorithm that can turn an input shape into the style of a cube while maintaining the content of the original shape.
