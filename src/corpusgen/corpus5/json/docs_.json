In stark contrast, direct stylization of  3D shapes or non-realistic modeling has received far less attention.

The availability of image stylization filters and non-photorealistic rendering techniques has dramatically lowered the barrier of creating artistic  imagery to the point that even a non-professional user can easily create stylized images.
