{"0": "The key insight is that cubic style sculptures can be captured by the as rigid as possible energy with a regularization on rotated surface normals. In stark contrast, direct stylization of  3D shapes or non-realistic modeling has received far less attention. ", "1": "We present a 3D stylization algorithm that can turn an input shape into the style of a cube while maintaining the content of the original shape. The key insight is that cubic style sculptures can be captured by the as rigid as possible energy with a regularization on rotated surface normals. "}
