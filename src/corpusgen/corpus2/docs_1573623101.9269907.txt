Abstraction uses a concept of point-of-view, which determines which aspects of source thing should be preserved in its sign thing and which should be suppressed. In the following, we approach this generic idea under a specific interactive framework. All these notions have a lot in common, yet there is a major discrepancy in the terminology and basic understanding about visual abstraction in the context of visualization. An abstraction is a process that transforms a source thing into a less concrete sign thing of the source thing. Visual abstraction is characterized by a conceptual space where this process exists, by the purpose it should serve, and by the perceptual and cognitive qualities of the beholder. These characteristics can be used to control the process of visual abstraction to produce effective and informative visual representations.
