{"msg": "It is a pictorial game consisting of interactive rounds of creation between artists and a machine. As such, the interaction is not innocuous, even though, contrarily to our daily experience, we have made the machine impact as explicit as possible with its recognizable blue contributions. Our installation where the machine projects completions without painting, combined with generative network capability, allows to explore that in a principled way. based on position and normal guidance Given a point cloud our algorithm is able to recognize multiscale ridge-valley features by judging the distance from the current point to the curvature extreme point. In general, point clouds are obtained by digitizing real objects with vision measuring equipment. ", "sender": "", "receivers": [], "sent": "", "subject": ""}
