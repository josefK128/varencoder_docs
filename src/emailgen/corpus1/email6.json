{"msg": "the main contributions of this paper are as follows. In stark contrast, direct stylization of 3D shapes or non-realistic modeling has received far less attention. We propose a new form of human-machine interaction. They repetitively paint one after the other. Our installation where the machine projects completions without painting, combined with generative network capability, allows to explore that in a principled way. As such, the interaction is not innocuous, even though, contrarily to our daily experience, we have made the machine impact as explicit as possible with its recognizable blue contributions.
