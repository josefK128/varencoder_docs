{"msg": "Our installation where the machine projects completions without painting, combined with generative network capability, allows to explore that in a principled way. They repetitively paint one after the other. We propose a new form of human-machine interaction. Different forms of the constraint can produce different enhancement effects, such as maintaining the original features as much as possible or creating sharper features. based on position and normal guidance Given a point cloud our algorithm is able to recognize multiscale ridge-valley features by judging the distance from the current point to the curvature extreme point.
